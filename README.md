## About

TypeScript is a statically-typed programming language that is a superset of JavaScript. It was developed by Microsoft and released in 2012. TypeScript adds optional static typing, classes, and interfaces to JavaScript, making it easier to build and maintain large-scale applications. TypeScript code is transpiled into JavaScript code that can run in any modern web browser or server-side environment that supports JavaScript. Some of the benefits of using TypeScript include improved code quality, better maintainability, and enhanced tooling support.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from the official website at https://nodejs.org.
2. Open a command prompt or terminal window.
3. Run the following command to install TypeScript globally:

```
npm install -g typescript
```

This will install the latest version of TypeScript globally on your system.

4. Verify that TypeScript is installed by running the following command:

```
tsc --version
```

This should print the version number of TypeScript that you just installed.

5. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Eggy115/TypeScript.git
