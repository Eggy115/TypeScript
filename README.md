## About

TypeScript is a statically-typed programming language that is a superset of JavaScript. It was developed by Microsoft and released in 2012. TypeScript adds optional static typing, classes, and interfaces to JavaScript, making it easier to build and maintain large-scale applications. TypeScript code is transpiled into JavaScript code that can run in any modern web browser or server-side environment that supports JavaScript. Some of the benefits of using TypeScript include improved code quality, better maintainability, and enhanced tooling support.
